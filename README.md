# CT-To-Do-List-Application
My first Coding Temple mini-project, building a simple to-do list application:
To run the To-Do List application:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Save the code to a file named todo_list_app.py.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where todo_list_app.py is saved.
5. Run the application using the command: python todo_list_app.py.

This application allows you to add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as complete, delete tasks, and quit the application. It includes input validation and error handling to ensure smooth user interaction.
